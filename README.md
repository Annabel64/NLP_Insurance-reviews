# NLP_Insurance-reviews


The dataset contains information on reviews left by customers on an insurance product. Each row in the dataset includes a date, a note about the review, the author of the review, the text of the review, the insurer and the type of product.

Problematic : What is the reason when the rating is low ? This is probably THE most important question for insurers when
facing with all these reviews. 

Objectives :
- predict the ratings of the "test" dataset
- find the reasons why the ratings to some insurance companies are this low

NB: the code was very long to execute. We built the notebook so that the executions you will do are done on a small amount of data, and that each part is independent of each other (each part will look for the cleaned and vectorized datasets in the folder that we have provided to you).

--> the main notebook is around 1min30 to execute
